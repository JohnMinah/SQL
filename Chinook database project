# Chinook Database SQL Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This project explores the **Chinook database** (a digital media store) using SQL to analyze customers, sales, and music trends. Key tasks include filtering geographic data, joining tables, aggregating metrics, and identifying top customers.  

## Database Schema

## Key Analyses  
1. **Geographic Segmentation**: Non-US customers and Brazilian sales trends.  
2. **Sales Agent Performance**: Invoices linked to support reps.  
3. **Time-Based Metrics**: 2009 revenue and invoice counts.  
4. **Music Catalog Insights**: Tracks, genres, and artist relationships.  

## SQL Highlights  
- Complex joins (customers, invoices, employees)  
- Aggregations (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `MIN`)  
- Window functions (genre-based comparisons)  
- Date filtering (`strftime` for year-based queries)
